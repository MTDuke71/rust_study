## Problem Type Distribution (Available Days)

| Category | Part 1 Count | Part 2 Count |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| String Processing | 2 | 2 |
| Mathematical | 2 | 2 |
| Simulation | 2 | 2 |
| Search/Traversal | 1 | 1 |
| Optimization | 0 | 1 |
| Data Structures | 1 | 1 |

## Implementation Notes

### Common Patterns Observed:
1. **Input Parsing**: Most problems require parsing structured input (dimensions, characters)
2. **Iterative Processing**: Process input character-by-character or line-by-line
3. **State Tracking**: Maintain running totals or current positions
4. **Part 2 Extensions**: Often adds complexity or early termination conditions to Part 1

### Rust-Specific Considerations:
- Day 1: Good for practicing iterator methods, `chars()`, `enumerate()`
- Day 2: Excellent for tuple destructuring, `split()`, `parse()`, mathematical operations
- Day 3: Perfect for HashSet usage, coordinate systems, `step_by()` iterators, even/odd index splitting
