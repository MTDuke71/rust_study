Let me first check what's on line 4 and what warning you're seeing:

Read test_documentation_standards.rs, lines 1 to 10

I can see line 4 has the import statement. The warning is likely about unused imports. Let me check what's actually being used in the file to see which imports are unused:

I can see all three imports are being used in the tests. The warning might be because these imports are only used inside the #[cfg(test)] module, but they're imported at the top level. Let me run a quick check to see what the exact warning is:


cd d:\repos\rust_study\Brackets_Basic && cargo check --example test_documentation_standards
Ah, I see the issue! The imports are marked as unused because they're only used inside the #[cfg(test)] module, but the main function doesn't use them. Here are several ways to eliminate this warning:

ðŸ”§ Solution Options:
Option 1: Move imports into the test module (Recommended)
test_documentation_standards.rs+1-3
Now let's verify the warning is gone:


cargo check --example test_documentation_standards
Perfect! The warning is gone. Let's also make sure the tests still run correctly:


cargo test --example test_documentation_standards
I see the issue! There are multiple test modules in the file that still have use super::*; but now there's nothing in the parent scope to import. Let me check the file structure and fix all the import issues:

There are multiple test modules! Let me fix all of them by adding the imports where needed and removing unused use super::*; statements:

Read test_documentation_standards.rs, lines 185 to 200

Read test_documentation_standards.rs, lines 220 to 240

Now I need to fix all the test modules by adding the proper imports. Let me update each one:

test_documentation_standards.rs+1-1
test_documentation_standards.rs+1-1
Now let's test again:


cargo test --example test_documentation_standards
Summarized conversation history

Great! Now let's check for warnings:


cargo check --example test_documentation_standards
Perfect! All warnings have been eliminated. Let me verify the final state of the file:

Read test_documentation_standards.rs, lines 1 to 50

Excellent! The warning on line 4 has been completely eliminated. The file now:

No more unused imports - The global use super::* statement has been removed from line 4
Clean compilation - No warnings when running cargo check
All tests pass - All 13 tests run successfully
Proper import organization - Each test module imports only what it needs:
test_documentation_examples imports brackets_basic::{validate_brackets, BracketError, BracketErrorKind}
performance_tests imports brackets_basic::validate_brackets
edge_case_tests imports brackets_basic::validate_brackets
The compiler warning has been successfully resolved by moving the imports from the global scope into the specific test modules that actually use them. This is a more precise and clean approach that eliminates unused imports while maintaining full functionality.
